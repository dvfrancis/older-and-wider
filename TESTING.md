Bugs

List all bugs encountered while coding.
Could use GitHub Issues to keep track of any issues (see Lewis Dillon's README for more information).
List any known, but unfixed bugs - and why they couldnâ€™t be fixed or recreated - or confirm there are none.
Could also list any mistakes made during project, such as using the wrong tense on commit messages.

Unfixed Bugs

Mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
Include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Lack of time, and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.

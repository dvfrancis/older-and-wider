## User Story Validation

Illustrate how the user story is fulfilled.
Present in tabular format as per https://github.com/4n4ru/CI_MS1_BodelschwingherHof.

## Browser Compatibility

Test deployed site in various browsers.
Could use animated GIFs to show results.

## Accessibility

Test deployed site using https://wave.webaim.org

## Responsiveness

Test deployed site for various device sizes using the Responsive Website Design Tester.

## Performance

Audit each page in Google Lighthouse.

## Bugs

List all bugs encountered while coding.
Could use GitHub Issues to keep track of any issues (see Lewis Dillon's README for more information).
List any known, but unfixed bugs - and why they couldnâ€™t be fixed or recreated - or confirm there are none.
Could also list any mistakes made during project, such as using the wrong tense on commit messages.

## Unfixed Bugs

Mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
Include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Lack of time, and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.

# The Older and Wider Podcast

## Overview

Older and Wider is a humorous (and [real](https://shows.acast.com/older-and-wider-podcast)) podcast, where two friends chat and share their day-to-day experiences as older women. It is hosted by retired television producer/writer, Judith Holder, and award-winning comedian, Jenny Eclair.

### Structure

#### User Flow diagram

![User flow diagram](assets/images/user-flow-diagram.webp)

### Skeleton

#### Wireframes

After I created the wireframes from my initial ideas, I decided that on mobile devices the hamburger menu should be centred on the screen (rather than over to the right of the screen). However, the wireframes still show this menu appearing to the right.

### Surface

#### Colours

The following colours have been used to add interesting backgrounds to site sections, with white (#FFF) as a contrasting colour, which is also used for all text:

![Website colour scheme](assets/images/website-colours.webp)

[Facebook Light Blue (#17A9FD) and Facebook Dark Blue (#0165E1)]:https://brandpalettes.com/facebook-colors
[Instagram Rose (#E1306C) and Instagram Purple Red (#C13584)]: https://brandpalettes.com/instagram-color-codes

For the Facebook social media icon I used [Facebook Light Blue (#17A9FD) and Facebook Dark Blue (#0165E1)] for the hover and active link states.

For the Instagram social media icon I used [Instagram Rose (#E1306C) and Instagram Purple Red (#C13584)] for the hover and active link states.

Colours used are palette 389 of the [Sarah Renae Clarke Colour Catalogue, Volume 2](https://sarahrenaeclark.com/shop/the-color-catalog-volume-2/).

#### Typography

Fonts were chosen from Google Fonts:
  
- [Marcellus](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marcellus) has been used for H1 and H2 tags.
- [Pontano Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Pontano+Sans) has been used for all other body text.

#### Media

All images used on the site have been taken from the Older & Wider podcast [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/olderandwiderpodcast) page and [merchandise website](https://olderandwidershop.com).

For the image carousels that appear on index.html and about.html, I used [RespImageLint](https://ausi.github.io/respimagelint/) to advise about creating alternates of all images that would be appropriate for different screens sizes. This was then implemented using the HTML `img` `srcset` attribute for each image used.

#### Content

All page content was initially written by myself, inspired by the sources listed in the credits, and then polished using Copilot in Microsoft Edge.

## Background Information

There are several references scattered across the site which refer back to items that are regularly mentioned, or discussed, on the podcast:

- Older and Wider Listeners are called OWLs.
- Snore Law is invoked by either Jenny or Judith when they feel the conversation has got too boring; this is usually accompanied by a loud snoring noise.
- Jenny and Judith both love coleslaw, and it is mentioned frequently.
- Anyone listening to the podcast is regarded as "part of the gang", or a "gang member".
- When people contact the podcast, the Jenny and Judith insist that people include their age with fractions; for example, "This email is from Sarah who is 59 and three quarters" (this is why the age field on the contact form is a text input).
- Jenny and Judith have stated that a Breton top is the de facto uniform of an OWL.
- Jenny and Judith regularly refer to the podcast Instagram page as the "message board".
- There are a couple of regular podcast features:
    - Culture corner - Jenny and Judith discuss any books they are reading, television they've enjoyed, visits to art galleries, etc.
    - Taste sensations - Jenny and Judith discuss any amazing meals they may have had in the previous week.

## Testing

## Credits and References

### General

- All images on this site are taken from either the podcast Instagram page or the merchandise website. Live links are also used for social media icons, and in the footer. This is done to help promote the podcast, and as a mark of respect for all the work that has gone into it. My intention is to contact the podcast, after this project has been assessed, to let them know it exists.
